# Spotube-Now-Playing-Script
This script helps Spotube users display in real-time what they are listening to on their streams. It reads the temporary files generated by Spotube, extracts the song title and artist, and saves it in a nowplaying.txt file, which can then be used in streaming software like OBS.
